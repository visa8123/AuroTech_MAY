AURO TECH SOLUTIONS INTERNSHIP

This repository is created for my internship program. I have been working as a python developer throughout this internship.

My First Task: ATM INTERFACE USING PYTHON

The ATMs in our cities are built on Python, as we have all seen them. It is a console-based application with five different classes. In order to use the system, the user must enter his or her user ID and pin when it starts. Once the details are entered successfully, ATM functionality is unlocked. As a result of the project, the following operations can be performed:

• Check Balance

• Withdraw

• Deposit

• Transfer

• Quit
